//! A Rust implementation of <https://github.com/runevision/LayerProcGen>
//!
//! The main entry point to access the data of layers is the [Layer] type.
//!
//! To create your own layers, you need to define a data type for the [Chunk]s of
//! that layer, and implement the [Chunk] trait for it. This trait also allows you
//! to specify other [Chunk] types whose layers you'll need information from to generate
//! the data of your own chunks.
//!
//! All coordinates are integer based (chunk position and borders), but the data within your
//! chunks can be of arbitrary data types, including floats, strings, etc.
//!
//! As an example, here's a layer that generates a point at its center:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use layer_proc_gen::{Chunk, GridPoint, Point2d, debug::DynLayer};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone, Default)]
//! struct MyChunk {
//!     center: Point2d,
//! }
//!
//! impl Chunk for MyChunk {
//!     type LayerStore<T> = std::sync::Arc<T>;
//!     type Dependencies = ();
//!     fn compute(&(): &(), index: GridPoint<Self>) -> Self {
//!         let center = Self::bounds(index).center();
//!         MyChunk { center }
//!     }
//!     fn clear(&(): &(), index: GridPoint<Self>) {
//!         // No dependencies to clear things from
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! There are builtin [Chunk] types for common patterns like generating uniformly
//! distributed points on an infinite grid.
